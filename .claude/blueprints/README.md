# Architecture blueprints

*[Português](README.pt-br.md)*

Each folder here is an architecture ready to generate a Spring Boot project through
`project-bootstrap` (`/init-project`). The full contract every `<id>.yaml` follows is
at `@.claude/blueprints/_schema.md` — each file's own `when_to_choose` and
`trade_offs` are the source of truth; this README is a quick-read summary to help pick
where to start. Across all of them, `rules/architecture-ddd.md` (framework-free
domain, constructor injection, one use case per class) holds without exception — what
changes from architecture to architecture is how layers are named and grouped, never
those invariants.

## Quick table

| Architecture | Build | Core idea |
|---|---|---|
| [`layered`](#layered-n-tier) | single-module | Controller → Service → Repository, the vocabulary most Spring tutorials already use |
| [`clean-architecture-single-module`](#clean-architecture-uncle-bob) | single-module | domain/application/infrastructure as packages |
| [`clean-architecture-multi-module`](#clean-architecture-uncle-bob) | multi-module | domain/application/infrastructure as Maven modules |
| [`hexagonal`](#hexagonal-ports--adapters) | multi-module | Ports (interfaces) and inbound/outbound adapters in their own modules |
| [`onion`](#onion-palermo) | multi-module | Domain model + domain services fused into one "Application Core"; any outer ring may call any inner ring |
| [`modular-monolith`](#modular-monolith-spring-modulith) | single-module | Several bounded contexts as module-packages (`internal`), verified by Spring Modulith |
| [`vertical-slice`](#vertical-slice-feature-slices) | single-module | One self-contained package per use case (`features.<feature>.<usecase>`), not per technical layer |
| [`custom-template`](#custom-template) | — | Starting point to describe your own architecture |

## `layered` (N-Tier)

**What:** classic Controller → Service → Repository stack, a single Maven module,
sibling packages (`controller`, `service`, `repository`, `entity`, `dto`, `mapper`).

**Pros**
- Vocabulary any Spring Boot team already knows — zero naming learning curve.
- Fewer files per feature: no port+adapter pair, the `Repository` is the boundary
  itself (`extends JpaRepository`).

**Cons**
- The boundary between layers is only validated by ArchUnit, not the compiler —
  nothing stops an improper import from compiling.
- Adding a second inbound/outbound channel later means editing the `Service` class's
  dependencies directly, with no port to swap behind.

**When to use it:** one inbound channel (REST) and one outbound channel (a single
relational database), CRUD-shaped work where a Spring Data repository is already
enough abstraction between service and database.

---

## Clean Architecture (Uncle Bob)

Two variants, same domain → application → infrastructure separation; the difference
is only where the boundary gets enforced.

### `clean-architecture-single-module`

**Pros:** no cost of maintaining 3 `pom.xml` files; same layering discipline as the
multi-module version.
**Cons:** the boundary is only validated at test time (ArchUnit) — a class in
`domain` can physically import Spring and only the test catches it.
**When to use it:** small/medium project where Maven's multi-module orchestration is
overhead nobody is going to amortize.

### `clean-architecture-multi-module`

**Pros:** the dependency rule is enforced by Maven itself (isolated compile =
boundary respected); a use case is a single class, no interface+impl boilerplate per
use case.
**Cons:** REST, persistence and messaging share a single `infrastructure` module — no
build isolation between adapters; swapping a use case's implementation means editing
the application layer, not just infra.
**When to use it:** long-lived system, small/medium team, business rules that need to
stay isolated from infrastructure details without paying for a module per adapter.

---

## Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)

**What:** domain at the center, ports as interfaces, inbound and outbound adapters at
the edges, each in its own module.

**Pros**
- Tests a use case without spinning up the Spring context.
- Swaps infrastructure without touching the domain — multiple inbound/outbound
  channels (REST + messaging + batch) coexist without conflict.

**Cons**
- More modules and more explicit mapping than `layered`.
- Steeper entry curve for newcomers to the project.
- Overkill for simple CRUD.

**When to use it:** more than one inbound or outbound channel, a real need to swap
infrastructure without touching the domain.

---

## Onion (Palermo)

**What:** domain model and domain services fused into a single, central "Application
Core" (Palermo's own term, no separate `application` module); persistence and
presentation as independent outer rings — but unlike `layered`, any outer ring may
call any inner ring directly.

**Pros**
- Palermo's own terminology (Application Core, Gateway) instead of hexagonal's
  port/adapter split.
- Persistence and presentation don't need to be strangers to each other, but never
  call each other directly.

**Cons**
- The domain module is bigger than hexagonal's or clean architecture's — model,
  services, and every `Gateway` interface live together, so more changes touch the
  same compilation unit.
- "Any outer ring may call any inner ring" is looser than `layered`'s strict
  adjacency rule — easier to accidentally couple things.
- Persistence gets one indirection more than hexagonal: Gateway → Adapter →
  Repository.

**When to use it:** domain model and domain services are designed and changed
together, by the same people, most of the time — not worth a fourth `application`
module just to keep them apart.

---

## `modular-monolith` (Spring Modulith)

**What:** one deployable, several bounded-context modules as direct sub-packages of
the application root, each with a hidden `internal` package and a small public
surface — verified at test time by `ApplicationModules.verify()`. Inside `internal`,
the same domain/application/adapter layering as hexagonal, at full rigor.

**Pros**
- A real module boundary without a separate deploy — an exit path to microservices
  already in place.
- `rules/architecture-ddd.md` never relaxes inside each module.

**Cons**
- A second verification tool on top of ArchUnit (`ApplicationModules.verify()`).
- Module names are business data, not architecture data — can't be pre-created
  before the first real use case exists.
- Still a single deployable: a runaway module can still exhaust the same JVM as
  every other module — structural isolation, not runtime isolation.

**When to use it:** several bounded contexts that don't yet justify separate
deployables, but need a boundary stronger than "please don't import that package"; or
when there's a real intent to split into microservices later.

---

## `vertical-slice` (Feature Slices)

**What:** code grouped by feature, not by technical layer — each use case gets its
own self-contained package (`features.<feature>.<usecase>`) with Command/Query,
Handler, Endpoint and Response (REPR pattern). Only the aggregate crosses the slice
boundary, kept in a shared `domain` kernel; the persistence port and its adapter live
inside the slice itself, not in a shared module like every other architecture here.

**Pros**
- Adding a feature costs only new files — never edits a service or repository class
  shared by everyone else.
- Isolation between slices reduces merge conflicts and prepares a future
  microservice extraction, one level below what `modular-monolith` does per bounded
  context.

**Cons**
- No mediator framework (MediatR's role in .NET) — no automatic
  validation/logging/transaction pipeline per handler, each slice wires its own.
- Persistence is scattered per slice instead of centralized — two slices touching the
  same aggregate can duplicate a port and query if nobody promotes it into the
  `domain` kernel.
- Sibling-slice isolation isn't a static ArchUnit rule (slice names don't exist yet
  at blueprint-authoring time) — only enforceable once a second slice exists, via
  ArchUnit's `slices()`.

**When to use it:** features diverge more than they overlap, the team wants a new
feature to cost only new files, or reuse across features matters less than isolation
and delivery speed.

## `custom-template`

Not an architecture — the starting point to describe your own. Copy
`custom-template/custom.template.yaml`, fill it in following `_schema.md`'s 5-rule
checklist, and validate: the final arbiter is the build (if it compiles respecting
the declared module boundaries, the architecture was respected).

## How to choose

See `@.claude/skills/project-bootstrap/references/blueprint-selection.md` for the
decision table shown during `/init-project` and the tie-breaker questions (inbound
channels in 12 months, bounded contexts, how many people touch the repo).
