// CI test: proves `ArchHook.jar guard sweep` reports, at Stop, a file this turn wrote outside
// the open phase's territory — whatever tool wrote it — and stays silent about a file that
// was already dirty when the turn began.
//
// Why this test exists: the sweep is the only guard that is filesystem-shaped instead of
// tool-shaped, and it is only as good as the baseline `guard prompt` takes at
// UserPromptSubmit. Break the baseline and it fails one of two ways, both quiet in review:
// it reports somebody's half-finished edit on every Stop (and gets routed around), or it
// reports nothing at all. Decision 0065.
//
// It also proves the one exemption, `guard.sweep_exempt`: the audit trail a hook writes during
// the turn is not handed back as the phase's write, while a Write to it is still refused.
// Decision 0105, issue #55.
//
// And it proves the sweep skips what a tool-time guard already admitted: a `/new-feature` run
// whose design skill wrote the spec and partials, whose executor wrote src/, and which then
// chained `git-publish` (class `ops`, nothing writable) and approved the folder, is silent —
// while a file no tool-time guard saw in that same turn is still named. Decision 0114,
// issue #74.
//
// Runs in a throwaway git repository holding a copy of the real extensions.json, so the
// territory under test is production data. Writes the files with plain Java — the point is
// that no tool-time guard saw them.
