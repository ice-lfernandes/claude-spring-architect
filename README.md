**An agent harness for Spring Boot on Claude Code.** It generates the project from an
architecture declared as data, designs every feature as an approved spec before any code
is written, and blocks at write time what that architecture forbids. Generated projects
carry the whole harness with them and can update it later.

Documentation: [`docs/en/`](docs/en/README.md) (English) · [`docs/pt-br/`](docs/pt-br/README.md)
(português). How it compares with similar projects, with sources:
[`docs/en/09-differentiators.md`](docs/en/09-differentiators.md).

Nerviz is pronounced *NAIR-viz*, like Nervi plus a z: it is named after Pier Luigi Nervi,
the engineer-architect whose structures are their own form. Formerly
`claude-spring-architect`; the old GitHub address redirects here.

Not affiliated with Anthropic, Broadcom or Oracle. Claude Code, Spring and Java are named
only to describe what Nerviz works with; this is not an official product of any of them.

## What this is, and what it is not

The working definition in 2026 is *agent = model + harness*. Claude Code supplies the
model and the tool loop. This repository supplies the rest of the harness for Spring Boot
work, in two parts:

- **Guides** steer the model before it acts: norms (`rules/`), procedures and exemplars
  (`skills/`), architecture blueprints, and the use-case spec of the feature being built.
- **Sensors** check what the model did, deterministically: hooks that refuse a write
  outside a skill's territory or a forbidden import, the incremental build, ArchUnit, a
  compose health gate, and a CI that validates the harness itself.

It is **not** a coding assistant: it brings no model and no editor. It is **not** an agent
framework like LangGraph or Spring AI: those build agents, and this repository constrains
one. And it is **not** a project template: it generates through Spring Initializr at run
time, and its job continues after generation, on every feature.

## The problem

You start a Java project with a 30-line `CLAUDE.md`. Six months later it is 400 lines, the
model ignores half of it, and the same rule lives in three skills that no longer agree.
The AI "forgets" the architecture because nothing tells it cheaply and reliably what is
true in this project, and nothing stops it when it gets it wrong.

Every new project also starts from zero. The same conventions get written again, and
nothing learned on the previous project survives.

## The approach

Treat the AI files as production code: an explicit architecture, dependencies in one
direction, one owning file per rule, and enforcement by a program rather than by the
model's memory. Concretely:

- **Architecture is data.** Seven blueprints (`hexagonal`, `clean-architecture-multi-module`,
  `clean-architecture-single-module`, `layered`, `onion`, `vertical-slice`,
  `modular-monolith`) plus your own, each a YAML file. One `forbidden_imports` declaration
  feeds the module's `CLAUDE.md`, the hook that blocks the write, and the POM graph. A new
  architecture touches no prompt, and CI checks that.
- **Versions are never written from memory.** The base project comes from
  `start.spring.io` at run time. CI fails if a Spring or Java version appears as a fact.
- **One use case per run, designed before it is built.** `/new-feature` passes the request
  through one owner skill per layer and consolidates an `UC-NNN-spec.md`. Only after
  approval does a restricted executor agent write code under `src/`.
- **Territory is enforced, not promised.** Every skill and agent has a class in
  `schemas/extensions.json`. The class says which paths it may write, and the `guard` hook
  refuses everything else, through file tools and shell commands alike. An approved spec
  folder is frozen.
- **Context stays cheap.** The root `CLAUDE.md` stays under 200 lines. Norms load through
  `paths` only when a file in their territory is touched.
- **Every run is measured.** In a generated project, each skill or agent invocation leaves
  a report with tokens and cost per piece, the call chain, files touched, and failures.

## Getting started

Requirements: JDK 21+, `git`, `curl`. Nothing else: no Python, no Node, no shell scripts,
no `mvn` on the `PATH` (the wrapper comes inside the Initializr's `starter.tgz`).

### New project

Order matters. Do these steps **before** opening Claude:

```bash
# 1. directory + git with an existing HEAD
mkdir my-api && cd my-api
git init
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: initial repository"

# 2. install .claude/ BEFORE starting the session
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nerviz-ai/nerviz /tmp/nerviz
cp -r /tmp/nerviz/.claude .

# 3. confirm the tools (nothing to install)
java --version && git --version && curl --version | head -1

# 4. commit the AI layer, separate from the code
git add .claude
git commit -m "chore: setup Claude Code"

# 5. only now open the session
claude
```

Then, inside the session:

```
/arch-doctor                 # confirms enforcement is active on this machine
/init-project --build maven
/new-feature <what the first use case should do>
```

Why this order:

- **`.claude/settings.json` is read once, at session startup.** If you copy it after
  opening `claude`, the hooks stay inactive until you restart, and everything *looks* like
  it works.
- **`git commit --allow-empty` comes first** because the `tests` hook uses `git diff HEAD`.
  In a repository without commits, `HEAD` does not exist and the hook exits without running
  a single test.
- **Committing `.claude/` before generating** keeps the next `git diff HEAD` to generated
  code only.

Do not copy this repository's root `CLAUDE.md` into your project. It describes the
meta-repository. The project's own `CLAUDE.md` is generated during bootstrap, with the
resolved versions and the real module list. The full generation sequence is in
[`docs/en/02-init-project.md`](docs/en/02-init-project.md).

### Existing project

From inside a session in that project, `/arch-adopt` installs this `.claude/` into a
project that was never generated here, or pulls a newer version into one that is behind.
It refuses a dirty worktree and writes through the deterministic `export` mode. It also
stamps `.claude/.arch-provenance.json`, so the next update names every file you edited by
hand before overwriting it. On an update, it prints the `migrations` notes for convention
changes the project has not seen yet; it never runs them. See
[`docs/en/10-arch-adopt.md`](docs/en/10-arch-adopt.md).

### Silent failures to know about

| Symptom | Cause | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Hooks never fire | `settings.json` copied with the session already open | Restart: `/exit`, then `claude -c` |
| Hooks fail on every OS | `java` not on `PATH` | `/arch-doctor` |
| A forbidden import is not blocked | `.claude/forbidden-imports.txt` does not exist yet (it is generated during init) | `/arch-doctor` shows the number of active rules |
| Tests never run on `Stop` | No `HEAD`, or no Maven wrapper | `/arch-doctor` |

The hooks exit 0 when they cannot verify something. That is safe, but it can give false
greens, which is why `/arch-doctor` exists. More traps, runtime and repository alike:
[`docs/en/11-pitfalls.md`](docs/en/11-pitfalls.md).

## Flows

### `/init-project` — creating the project

```
/init-project
     │
     ▼  agent: project-initializer (isolated context, model: sonnet)
     │
     ├─ 1. INTERVIEW — blueprint · coordinates · build · features
     ├─ 2. VALIDATES blueprint — 6-rule checklist            [fails fast]
     ├─ 3. BASE via Spring Initializr (curl)                 [GA versions, nothing hardcoded]
     ├─ 4. RESTRUCTURES into modules per the blueprint       [exemplars give the shape]
     ├─ 5. GENERATES forbidden-imports.txt + root and <module>/CLAUDE.md, CI, Checkstyle,
     │      lombok.config, logback, Dockerfile + docker-compose
     ├─ 6. EXPORTS norms, development skills, executor agents — the project is self-contained
     ├─ 7. INSTALLS hooks (ArchHook.jar + extensions.json + settings.json), opens the audit trail
     ├─ 8. VERIFIES build + smoke + tested boundary block; writes README + GENESIS.md
     ├─ 9. REPORT in the fixed output contract
     └─ if the build is green: OFFERS git-publish — two independent confirmations
```

No business code is generated: no `ExampleController` to delete. The first feature comes
from a real spec.

### `/new-feature` — one use case, spec first

```
/new-feature <feature description>     (or UC-NNN-slug to resume, or empty to list)
     │
     use-case-design → domain-modeling → rest-api-architect
        → security-architect (conditional) → messaging-architect (conditional)
        → jobs-architect (conditional) → persistence-architect → test-architect
     │  one use case per run; a split goes to docs/use-cases/BACKLOG.md
     │  design skills write only docs/ — never src/, never docker-compose.yml, never git
     │  each one decides the design patterns of its own layer, in its partial
     │
     ▼  consolidates into UC-NNN-spec.md (status: draft)
     ▼  asks approval → status: approved (the guard hook freezes the folder from here)
     │
     ├─ implement now → pre-flight once per project (ArchUnit, logging/masking aspects)
     │                → agent: java-spring-boot-developer, pattern catalog injected at start
     │                → status: implemented (or implemented-blocked)
     │                → git-publish (feature commit)
     └─ not now       → git-publish (the approved spec only)
```

Each step's output contract is literally the next step's input contract. A free-prose
handoff degrades by the third hop. Details: [`docs/en/03-new-feature.md`](docs/en/03-new-feature.md).

### Edit cycle — what runs on every write in a generated project

```
prompt (UserPromptSubmit)
     └─ guard prompt        baseline of the working tree for this turn's sweep

Write / Edit
     ├─ guard               path outside the active skill's or agent's territory → blocked
     │                      approved spec folder → blocked
     │                      Skill(build class) during a design run → blocked
     ├─ schema              frontmatter + body of .claude/**/*.md, .mcp.json   (blocks)
     ├─ format              spotless on the touched module                    (never blocks)
     ├─ check               forbidden imports + incremental test-compile      (blocks)
     └─ audit               file touched → appended to the run's log          (never blocks)

Bash
     └─ guard bash          force push → refused; a redirect, sed -i, tee… outside
                            the territory or into a frozen folder → blocked

SubagentStart
     └─ context subagent    design-pattern catalog → agents whose class asks for it

Stop
     ├─ guard sweep         what git sees changed this turn, re-checked       (blocks)
     ├─ compose gate        a service down, or published and unreachable      (blocks)
     ├─ audit flush         renders the run's report + ledger line            (never blocks)
     └─ tests               tests of the changed modules                      (blocks)
```

### Audit trail — what every run cost

Excerpt of a real report from a `/new-feature` run in a demo project:

The trail is a hook, not a skill. It survives the model forgetting and the session dying,
and it costs zero tokens to produce. Prompts are redacted before they land in git.
`/audit-usage` aggregates the ledgers across runs. Details:
[`docs/en/08-audit-usage.md`](docs/en/08-audit-usage.md).

### Issues — filed from a project, verified here

`/report-issue`, run inside a generated project, files an issue on this repository. It
refuses a report with no evidence, warns when the project is behind the latest release, and
strips the project's own code and names from the body. Here, `/triage-issue <N>` has a
read-only agent check every claim against `HEAD`, including the reporter's diagnosis and
proposed fix, before anything is commented or designed. Details:
[`docs/en/12-issues.md`](docs/en/12-issues.md).

---

## What is in the box

| Piece | Count | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture blueprints | 7 + a template for your own | `.claude/blueprints/` |
| Norms, loaded on demand through `paths` | 15 | `.claude/rules/` |
| Skills (design, orchestration, build, ops, meta…) | 22 | `.claude/skills/` |
| Agents (driver, executor, installer, verifier) | 5 | `.claude/agents/` |
| Hook modes, in one Java file | 11 | `.claude/hooks/ArchHook.java` |
| Decision records — why each piece has its form | 100+ | `.claude/decisions/` |

**Design skills of the `/new-feature` pipeline:** `use-case-design`, `domain-modeling`,
`rest-api-architect`, `security-architect` (Spring Security on the servlet stack: who may
call each endpoint, JWT, opaque token, API key, 401/403, CORS), `messaging-architect` (Kafka
producer and consumer, retry, DLQ), `jobs-architect` (`@Scheduled`, ShedLock, Quartz,
Spring Batch, db-scheduler, JobRunr; the outbox relay), `persistence-architect`,
`test-architect`.

**Cross-cutting concerns that arrive solved:** `Idempotency-Key` through AOP, logging with
sensitive-data masking, an OTLP collector with Jaeger or Grafana + Tempo + Prometheus,
SonarQube or SonarCloud setup, compose port-collision and reachability checks, and
`permissions.deny` on secrets files.

**What travels into a generated project:** the norms, the development skills, the executor
agents, the hook and its schema, and the active blueprint. The manifest of what travels is
data, the `export` block of `schemas/extensions.json`, and the `schema` hook fails if a
skill or agent on disk is missing from it. Creation-only pieces stay here:
`project-bootstrap`, `init-project`, `claude-code-architect-designer`, `triage-issue`,
`project-initializer`, `issue-verifier`, and the blueprint catalog. `arch-adopt` is the one
creation skill that travels, because it is how the project updates itself once this
repository is out of the picture.

## Blueprints

| ID | Layout | Choose if | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `layered` | single-module | CRUD, familiar controller/service/repository vocabulary | ArchUnit is the only boundary, not the compiler |
| `clean-architecture-multi-module` | multi-module | Long-lived system, medium or large team | More ceremony, many mappings |
| `clean-architecture-single-module` | single-module | Clean Architecture without the module count | ArchUnit is the only boundary |
| `hexagonal` | multi-module | Several entry and exit channels | More modules than layered |
| `onion` | multi-module | Palermo's terminology; persistence and presentation as independent peers | Larger domain compilation unit |
| `vertical-slice` | single-module | Loosely coupled features, fast delivery | Duplication between slices |
| `modular-monolith` | single-module | Several bounded contexts (Spring Modulith) | A second verifier (`ApplicationModules.verify()`) on top of ArchUnit |
| `custom` | your choice | You already have an in-house pattern | You describe and validate it |

Do not default to the fanciest architecture. Over-engineering is paid every day;
under-engineering is paid once, at refactor time.

To add one, copy `.claude/blueprints/custom-template/custom.template.yaml`, fill it in, and
make it pass the 6-rule checklist in `_schema.md`: an acyclic `depends_on` graph, exactly
one `contains_main`, every referenced feature and template existing, and honest
`trade_offs`. No skill, agent, or prompt changes. Contract and pros and cons of each:
[`docs/en/05-blueprints.md`](docs/en/05-blueprints.md) ·
[`.claude/blueprints/README.md`](.claude/blueprints/README.md).

## How the harness itself is built

The same Clean Architecture applied to Java code applies to the AI files. Dependencies flow
in one direction, with no cycles:

```
                    ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
   INFRA/ENFORCE    │  hooks/  ·  settings.json            │  deterministic
                    └──────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                                   │ verifies
                    ┌──────────────▼───────────────────────┐
   ADAPTERS         │  agents/  (isolated execution)       │  entry points
                    └──────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                                   │ invokes
                    ┌──────────────▼───────────────────────┐
   APPLICATION      │  skills/  (procedure + exemplars)    │  the "how"  ·  /name
                    └──────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                                   │ cites (never copies)
                    ┌──────────────▼───────────────────────┐
   DOMAIN           │  rules/   (norms)  ·  blueprints/    │  the "what / what not"
                    └──────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↑ LEAF — references no one
```

The rules that follow from it, all gated in CI (the full list of eleven invariants is in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)):

1. **`rules/` is a leaf.** A norm never mentions a skill, agent, or command.
2. **Each norm has one owning file.** Others cite it by path. A rule written in two places
   will diverge.
3. **`CLAUDE.md` is an index, not a manual.** Invariants and routing, under 200 lines.
4. **Skills own their exemplars.** Boilerplate lives in `templates/*.example` inside the
   skill that emits it, never in a norm.
5. **No `commands/`.** A skill with `disable-model-invocation: true` gives the same `/name`
   plus a support folder, `paths`, and `context: fork`.
6. **An agent exists for one of three reasons only:** preserving context, restricting
   tools, or changing model. Otherwise it is a skill.
7. **Hooks verify, they do not teach.** If a rule must always hold, it is a hook or a
   `permissions.deny` line, not prose.

### Where to write what

| You are writing | Goes to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Never use `@Autowired` on a field" | `rules/naming.md` | A norm, single source |
| "How to create a REST adapter, step by step" | `skills/rest-api-architect/SKILL.md` | A procedure |
| A reference `Controller.java` | `skills/rest-api-architect/templates/` | The exemplar of the skill that applies it |
| "The domain does not import Spring" | `rules/architecture-ddd.md` + `blueprints/*.yaml` | A norm plus verifiable data |
| "Run spotless after editing" | `hooks/ArchHook.java` + `settings.json` | Verifiable by command |
| "Never read `application-prod.yml`" | `settings.json` → `permissions.deny` | Compliance is enforced, not requested |
| "This skill may only write under `docs/use-cases/`" | `schemas/extensions.json` → `skill_classes` | Territory is data a hook reads |
| A ritual you trigger by hand (`/release`) | `skills/release/SKILL.md` + `disable-model-invocation: true` | No new `commands/` |

New pieces are designed with `/claude-code-architect-designer`, which picks one of eight
forms (or "create nothing") and records hooks and permissions under `decisions/`. The
frontmatter fields the runtime recognizes are data in `schemas/extensions.json`, explained
in [`frontmatter-fields.md`](.claude/skills/claude-code-architect-designer/references/frontmatter-fields.md).
The runtime ignores an unknown field without a word, so `ArchHook.java schema` fails on one.

## Enforcement: one Java file, no shell

Every hook launches `.claude/hooks/ArchHook.jar`, compiled from the single source file
`ArchHook.java` and invoked in exec form:

```json
{ "type": "command", "command": "java",
  "args": ["-jar", "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/ArchHook.jar", "check"] }
```

No shell is invoked, so bash, Git Bash, WSL, or PowerShell make no difference. There is one
implementation instead of a `.sh` and a `.ps1` that drift apart. And the dependency
already exists, because the audience has a JDK by definition. The jar is committed, and CI
requires it to be byte for byte what the source compiles to under the pinned JDK.
Startup costs about 0.3 s per invocation.

| Mode | Event | Blocks? | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `check` | `PostToolUse` on writes to `.java` | yes | forbidden imports + incremental `test-compile` of the touched module |
| `format` | same | no | `spotless:apply` on the module |
| `tests` | `Stop` | yes | tests of the modules changed since `HEAD`, deferred while a writer subagent runs |
| `schema` | `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `Stop` | yes | frontmatter and body of skills, agents, rules; `.mcp.json` with a secret scan; hook registrations; the export manifest |
| `guard` | `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse` (`Write`/`Edit`, `Bash`, `Skill`/`Agent`), `Stop` | yes | write territory per skill and agent class (allowlist, deny by default); frozen approved specs; no `build`-class skill during a design run; force pushes refused; end-of-turn sweep |
| `compose` | `Stop` (`gate`), manual, inside `doctor` | `gate` only | services running, no foreign container on the ports, reachable published ports, `image:` tags matching `src/test`, `${VAR:default}` that holds on the host and in the `app` container |
| `context` | `SubagentStart` (generated project) | no | hands the design-pattern catalog to agents whose class declares it |
| `audit` | eleven lifecycle events (generated project) | no | execution trail of every skill and agent |
| `doctor` | manual (`/arch-doctor`) | no | diagnoses the setup on this machine |
| `export` | manual (through `/arch-adopt`) | no | writes a target project's `.claude/` from the manifest, with the provenance stamp |
| `build` | `PostToolUse` on `ArchHook.java` (this repo), manual | no | rebuilds the jar; `--verify` compares it byte for byte |

Every list the hook reads is data in `schemas/extensions.json`, never a constant in the
Java. A new skill is validated, audited, and fenced into its territory by adding one entry
to a class.

## CI

The invariants in `CLAUDE.md` are prose until something checks them. `validate.yml` runs on
every push and PR:

- **Hooks on three operating systems.** `doctor`, `build --verify`, and the tests under
  `.claude/.ci/` run on `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, and `windows-latest`. Each test
  injects a violation (a forbidden import, a write outside a territory, a force push, a
  compose tag mismatch…) and requires the block, against the same jar the hooks run.
- **The harness's own design.** `rules/` is a leaf, each norm has one owner, no code in a
  norm, no `commands/`, a new blueprint touches no prompt, no hardcoded Spring or Java
  version, no dependency outside the Java ecosystem, the export manifest matches the disk.
- **Exemplars that compile.** Every `import` in every `.java.example` resolves against a
  classpath downloaded from a real `start.spring.io` request.
- **Deterministic export.** Two exports per blueprint produce identical trees, and the
  exported `.claude/` validates on its own.

Every job and step, plus the known gaps: [`docs/en/07-ci-validate.md`](docs/en/07-ci-validate.md).

## Limits, said plainly

- **Claude Code only.** Hooks, `paths`, `disable-model-invocation`, and `context: fork`
  belong to the Claude Code runtime. Nothing here runs on Codex, Cursor, or Copilot.
- **Spring Boot only, servlet stack.** No WebFlux, no Quarkus or Micronaut, no front end.
- **The full pipeline is expensive by design.** One real `/new-feature` run cost about
  USD 15 for a two-field aggregate. The audit trail exists to measure that; the levers are
  in [`docs/en/03-new-feature.md`](docs/en/03-new-feature.md).
- **Rigor has a learning curve.** The guards refuse writes on purpose. When one blocks, its
  message names the rule and the fix, and [`docs/en/11-pitfalls.md`](docs/en/11-pitfalls.md)
  explains each one.

## Contributing

Blueprints and norms are the most useful contributions. Full guide, per file type:
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Before opening a PR:

- A new blueprint passes the 6-rule checklist in `_schema.md` and declares honest
  `trade_offs`.
- A new norm lives in its own file under `rules/`, is listed in `00-index.md`, and is not
  copied into any skill.
- No PR pins a Java or Spring Boot version.
- No PR adds a dependency outside JDK, git, and curl. `validate.yml` fails if it does.
- `java .claude/hooks/ArchHook.java doctor` and `schema` both pass locally.
