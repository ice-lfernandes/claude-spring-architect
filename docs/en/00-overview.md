# Overview — `.claude/` architecture

## What this repository generates

`claude-spring-architect` turns an empty directory into a Spring Boot project with declared
architecture, executable boundaries (hooks), and an already-installed design→code
pipeline. It doesn't compile anything itself — no `pom.xml`, no Maven tests. The
product is instruction files.

That central idea shapes everything: this repository's own `.claude/` is organized as
a Clean Architecture, with dependencies pointing in a single direction. That's not a
metaphor — it's the real rule of who may cite whom (`CLAUDE.md` § Invariants 1 and 2).

## Legend

| Symbol/color | Type | What it means here |
|---|---|---|
| 🟥 Red | **Hook** (`settings.json` + `ArchHook.java`) | Deterministic enforcement. Runs whenever the event fires, regardless of the model's decision. See [01-file-types.md](01-file-types.md#hook) |
| 🟦 Blue | **Skill** (`SKILL.md`) | Procedure. Becomes part of the model's repertoire; can be invoked by command or automatically. See [§ Skill](01-file-types.md#skill) |
| 🟪 Purple | **Agent** (`.claude/agents/*.md`) | Isolated execution — own context, restricted tools, different model. See [§ Agent](01-file-types.md#agent-subagent) |
| 🟩 Green | **Rule** (`.claude/rules/*.md`) | Norm. A leaf of the graph — never mentions a skill, agent, or command. See [§ Rule](01-file-types.md#rule) |
| 🟧 Orange | **Blueprint** (`.claude/blueprints/*/*.yaml`) | Declarative architecture data. A leaf like rules, but in YAML, not prose. See [05-blueprints.md](05-blueprints.md) |
| ⬛ Gray | **`CLAUDE.md`** | Index and routing table. Always loads at session start. See [§ CLAUDE.md](01-file-types.md#claudemd) |
| Solid line | Active call | One piece invokes another via Skill tool, Agent tool, or direct exec |
| Dashed line | Citation/read | One piece reads or cites another by path, without invoking it |

## Why the direction of the arrows matters

This repository's structural rule (`CLAUDE.md` § Invariants 1, 4, and 6) is: **rules
never mention skills, agents, or commands**. If a rule needed to invoke something, it
would stop being a norm and become a procedure — and a procedure is a skill. That's
why, in the diagram, arrows from `rules/` and `blueprints/` are always dashed and
always point outward from whoever reads them, never the other way.

Likewise, an agent only exists for one of three valid reasons (`CLAUDE.md` § Invariant
5): preserving context, restricting tools, or switching model. `project-initializer`
and `java-spring-boot-developer` meet all three reasons at once;
`archunit-installer` and `commons-logging-installer` meet only the first (preserving
context — neither has an interview, and isolating the `curl`/`./mvnw` they run keeps
that noise from becoming permanent in the main conversation). One reason is already
enough under Invariant 5. Each agent documents its own reason in the `## Why this is an
agent` (or `## Why this is Form 3`) section.

The hook is the only piece outside that citation graph: `settings.json` fires it on
lifecycle events, and what it reads (`forbidden-imports.txt`, `extensions.json`) is
data, not prose.

Three modes depend on where they are registered. `guard` runs **here and in the generated
project**: it keeps every skill inside the territory its class declares in
`skill_classes`, and every subagent inside its `agent_classes` territory (deny by
default), freezes approved specs, refuses a call to a `build`-class skill while a design
run is open, reads shell commands for the write shapes it can resolve (`guard bash`) and
refuses a force push, and on `Stop` sweeps what the turn changed on disk (`guard sweep`).
`audit` runs only in the generated project, because it switches itself on by the presence
of `.claude/audit-usage/` and this meta-repo doesn't create the directory — auditing the
*design* of the tool instead of its use is not the trail anyone wants. `context subagent`
is registered only in the generated project too, at `SubagentStart`: it hands the
`gof-design-patterns` catalog to every agent whose class declares `pattern_catalog: true`.
See [08-audit-usage.md](08-audit-usage.md).

That same `skill_classes` is what standardizes each skill's **body**: `ArchHook.java
schema` requires every `SKILL.md` on disk to sit in exactly one class, declare
`**Class:** <c>` in its body, and carry the sections that class asks for. Before it,
nine skills said `## Contract`, one said `## Skill contract`, and two had no contract
section at all — with `claude plugin validate` printing `✔ Validation passed` over all
of it.

## The commands, in one line each

| Command | What it does | Details |
|---|---|---|
| `/init-project` | Interview → picks a blueprint → generates the complete Spring Boot project structure, with no business code | [02-init-project.md](02-init-project.md) |
| `/new-feature <description>` | Designs one use case per run (use case → domain → REST → messaging and jobs when they apply → persistence → tests) into a single spec, asks approval, and offers the executor | [03-new-feature.md](03-new-feature.md) |
| `/arch-doctor` | Diagnoses active hooks, loaded boundaries, Maven wrapper, `java` on PATH, schema, audit trail, compose services | [04-arch-doctor.md](04-arch-doctor.md) |
| `/audit-usage` | Reads the generated project's audit trail: spend per skill and agent across runs, failure rate, which report to open. Here it reports the trail is off | [08-audit-usage.md](08-audit-usage.md) |
| `/claude-code-architect-designer` | Decides which of the eight forms (auto-invocable skill, manual skill, agent, rule, `CLAUDE.md` section, MCP server, hook, `permissions` rule — or nothing) solves a scenario, and writes the file after approval. Meta-repo only | [06-claude-code-architect-designer.md](06-claude-code-architect-designer.md) |
| `/arch-adopt` | Installs this `.claude/` into a project never generated here, or updates one that is behind. Refuses a dirty worktree, writes through the `export` mode, and leaves the diff ready for review | [10-arch-adopt.md](10-arch-adopt.md) |

`git-publish` isn't a fourth top-level command — it's a Form 1 skill (no
`disable-model-invocation`) chained automatically by `project-initializer` (end of
`/init-project`, if the build passed) and by `/new-feature` (every end of the flow with an approved spec —
after the executor succeeds, or docs-only when the user declines implementing), and also directly invocable by the user. Two `AskUserQuestion` gates
in the skill's body replace the flag as the guard — the same D17 pattern
(`@.claude/decisions/0007-pipeline-skills-invocation.md`), documented in
`@.claude/decisions/0034-git-publish-skill.md`.
