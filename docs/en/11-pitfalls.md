# Pitfalls

Primary source: `@claude-help.md`, `.claude/schemas/extensions.json` (the `settings`,
`injections`, `arguments`, `types`, `guard` and `compose` blocks), what
`java .claude/hooks/ArchHook.java schema` checks, and the decision records each item cites.

## Why this page exists

Every item below is a trap that fails **silently**, or that a hook refuses with a message the
reader has to already understand. The page has two parts:

- **Part 1 — the Claude Code runtime.** Holds for any project that uses skills, agents, hooks
  or MCP: nothing errors, nothing warns, and the piece simply does not do what its author
  believes it does.
- **Part 2 — this repository.** Facts of this `.claude/`: write territories, frozen spec
  folders, who owns `pom.xml` and the outbox, what `guard sweep` and `compose gate` do and do
  not cover.

Both used to live in `@CLAUDE.md` § Known pitfalls, which is read in every session. Part 1
left in decision `0061`, part 2 in decision `0090`. Neither needs to be permanently in
context: they are needed while someone designs or edits a piece of `.claude/`, or writes
about one — which is when `claude-code-architect-designer` reads this page. Most of part 2
also sits behind `guard`, `schema` or `compose gate`, whose block message names the rule and
the fix. `@CLAUDE.md` keeps only the three facts that bite in any session with no hook behind
them, and points here with one row of its routing table.

**A new pitfall goes here, in both languages — never back into `@CLAUDE.md`.** That route is
what refilled the section between `0061` and `0090`.

What is **not** here: the frontmatter fields the runtime recognizes, which are data with a
single owner in `.claude/schemas/extensions.json` and are described in
[01-file-types.md](01-file-types.md).

## Part 1 · The Claude Code runtime

### Skills

**A skill cannot have the name of a native slash command.** The folder name becomes the
command, and `/doctor`, `/init`, `/context`, `/memory` already exist in the runtime. That is
why this repo's diagnostic skill is called `arch-doctor`. Shadowing a native command produces
no error — it runs the wrong command. `ArchHook.java schema` fails the folder by name, against
`types.skill.native_commands` in `.claude/schemas/extensions.json` — a list that has to grow
when the runtime gains a command.

**`$ARGUMENTS` in the body of a skill is interpolated at every occurrence**, not only under
`## Target`. A sentence that talks *about* the argument reaches the model with the real value
inside it: `/new-feature`'s "invoke `test-architect` with empty `$ARGUMENTS` (setup mode)"
arrived as "with empty `UC-003-initiate-kyc-verification` (setup mode)" — an order to use
setup mode, naming the argument that means design mode. Write "the argument" or "the target
above"; `ArchHook.java schema` rejects the literal, reading `arguments` from
`.claude/schemas/extensions.json`.

**`allowed-tools` with `Bash(command:*)` checks each segment of the pipe separately.** An
injection `` !`a | b | c` `` in the body needs a rule for `a`, `b`, and `c`; miss one and the
whole command is blocked before it runs. Write injections as a single command
(`ls .claude/skills`, not `find … | sed | sort`). This only affects skills that restrict Bash:
`allowed-tools: Bash` without a filter lets the whole pipeline through.

**A frontmatter `` !`…` `` injection runs in the session's persistent shell, at whatever cwd
it currently holds.** A `cd` into a skill directory in one `Bash` call contaminates every
injection of every skill invoked afterward, and a relative `test -f` then reports a file as
absent while it exists. Read a template with `Read` at an absolute path, never `cd` + `cat`.
Every injection in this repo resolves paths from `"${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}"`, and
`ArchHook.java schema` blocks one that doesn't — a genuinely cwd-independent injection needs a
regex in `injections.exempt_patterns`.

**A skill with `disable-model-invocation: true` listed in an agent's `skills:` is not
preloaded — and nothing warns.** The agent starts without it, and a body saying "catalog
preloaded" tells it to apply something the model never received. That was
`gof-design-patterns` (then `java-patterns`) in `java-spring-boot-developer`. To hand a
manual skill's content to an agent, inject it at `SubagentStart` (`ArchHook.java context
subagent`, decision 0077), not through `skills:`.

**Everything the model must obey lives in the body of the file**, never in frontmatter.
`metadata.*` was removed from skills and agents: ownership, `reads`, `handoff` and contracts
live in the body's `## Contract` section. Do not put `metadata:` back into a `SKILL.md` — it
costs tokens on every invocation and enforces nothing.

### Frontmatter and validation

**The runtime silently ignores unknown frontmatter.** An invented field is decoration, not
behavior. List of native fields in `@claude-help.md`.

**`claude plugin validate` does not validate fields.** It accepts `metadata:`, accepts
camelCase in a skill, and accepts an invented field, always with `✔ Validation passed`. It
does not look at `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/rules/`, or `.claude/settings.json`. It catches
malformed YAML, nothing else. What validates fields is
`java .claude/hooks/ArchHook.java schema`.

### Hooks

**`.claude/settings.json` is only read at session startup.** Editing hooks mid-session has no
effect — `claude` must be restarted.

**A hook fails silently in four ways, none an error.** Unknown event name — never fires.
`matcher` on an event that doesn't read one — filters nothing. Pipe or `&&` inside `"command"`
— part of the filename (exec form: `command` is the binary, `args` the arguments). A mode that
throws — exits 0 through `main`'s catch, looks like it passed. `schema` catches the first
three, from the `settings` block of `.claude/schemas/extensions.json`; the fourth only by
running the mode by hand.

**An `if` with a path only matches through `Edit(...)` or `Read(...)`.** `Edit` covers every
built-in tool that writes a file, `Write` included; an `"if": "Write(.claude/**/*.md)"` looks
like a filter and filters nothing. Source: `docs/pt-br/claude-code-docs/07-settings-permissoes-e-seguranca.md`.

**Only the hook-protocol modes of `ArchHook.java` read stdin** — `check`, `format`, `tests`,
`schema`, `audit`, `guard`, `context`, and `compose gate`. Invoking one of those by hand without
`</dev/null` blocks until something closes stdin, with no output: a command that looks hung,
not failed. `export`, `doctor`, `build` and the bare `compose` are invoked by people and read
nothing.

### `AskUserQuestion`

**It rejects a question with fewer than 2 options, and rejects the whole batch with it:**
`InputValidationError ... "too_small" ... path: ["questions",1,"options"]`. A question with one
option isn't a question — decide it, and record the decision where the answer would have gone.
The batch also has an upper bound of 4 questions per call. The generated project carries the
same pitfall in its own `CLAUDE.md`, from
`project-bootstrap/templates/root.CLAUDE.md.example`.

### MCP

**`.mcp.json` is only read at session startup**, same as `settings.json`. Adding or editing a
server mid-session has no effect until `claude` is restarted.

**A project-scoped server in `.mcp.json` needs one-time human approval** the first time it
loads (`claude mcp list` shows pending ones). That prompt is the trust boundary a cloned
repository can't skip — never work around it with `enableAllProjectMcpServers`.

**Server precedence is `local > project > user`, silently.** A personal server with the same
name as the team's `.mcp.json` one shadows it — no warning either way.

**An unset `${VAR}` in `.mcp.json` doesn't fail generation.** The server loads with the literal
`${VAR}` text and fails to connect at runtime instead. `claude mcp list` surfaces the
missing-variable warning; frontmatter schema validation does not.

## Part 2 · This repository

### Write territory and the guards

**A skill writes only its class's territory, and `guard` blocks the rest with exit 2.** Deny
by default; the message names the class and its `write_allow`, and the fix is the data
(`skill_classes` in `.claude/schemas/extensions.json`), never a retry. A design run is
docs-only and cannot even *call* a `build`-class skill — `docker-architect` included: the
missing compose service is recorded in the partial and materialized afterwards by
`/docker-architect`. With no skill phase open, territory is unrestricted, which is why
editing a file by hand is never blocked.

**A skill that chains another of its own class adds that skill's territory; another class
replaces it.** Same class — `arch-adopt` → `sonarqube-setup` → `docker-architect`, all
`build` — and the phase holds all three, so each writes its own paths and the caller keeps
writing after the callee returns. Other class — `/new-feature` calling a design skill — and
the phase narrows to the callee, which is what keeps a design step docs-only. The rule used
to keep only the caller's territory on a same-class call, on the assumption that one class
means one territory; `build` gives each skill its own, and `sonarqube-setup` chained from
`arch-adopt` was refused `pom.xml`. Design: `.claude/decisions/0092-guard-same-class-chain-sums-territories.md`.

**A subagent's write is judged by `agent_classes`, not by the caller's phase.** Every write
carries its `agent_type`, and `guard` checks the path against the agent's own `write_allow`,
so an open design phase neither widens nor narrows it. An agent no class lists falls back to
the caller's phase — nothing else describes what it may write.

**Enforcement is no longer tool-shaped, but it is still not filesystem-shaped.** Until
lessons-learned-014 § 1 every hook matched on a tool name, so a heredoc, a `sed -i` or a
`tee` passed through `guard`, `check`, `format`, `audit` and `schema` alike — the exact
spellings a host instruction to prefer `Bash` over `Write`/`Edit` produces. `guard bash`
(`PreToolUse`, matcher `Bash`) now reads the command for the write shapes in
`guard.bash_write_shapes` and applies the territory and frozen-folder checks to every target
it can read literally. **What it deliberately does not do:** a target holding `$`, a backtick
or a glob, or landing outside the repository, is skipped without a word, and `check` and
`format` stay off `Bash` entirely — ArchUnit and `spotless:apply` already re-check both,
while a `PostToolUse` matcher there would pay a JVM on every `ls`. So the true statement is
narrow: **inside Claude Code, through `Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit`/`NotebookEdit`, and through
the shell spellings the shape list names.** Design:
`.claude/decisions/0063-bash-write-enforcement.md`.

**`guard sweep` backs both write guards on `Stop`, and it is git-shaped.** It diffs the
working tree against the baseline `guard prompt` takes at `UserPromptSubmit`, so a tree dirty
before the turn is not reported, and it runs the same territory and frozen-folder checks over
whatever changed — no matter which tool wrote it. Two limits worth knowing before reading it
as total coverage: it is **detection, not prevention** (the write already happened), and a
path git ignores never appears in `git status --porcelain` and is never swept — which in this
repository is only what `.gitignore` still lists, `.claude/decisions/` and
`.claude/lessons-learned/` having been versioned since 2026-09-28. A spec's `status:` close and
its `[ ]` → `[x]` toggles are admitted by comparing against `git show HEAD:`, since the sweep
has no `old_string` to read. Paths in `guard.sweep_exempt` are skipped — today `.claude/audit-usage/**`, the versioned trail the `audit` hook writes in parallel with the baseline; the tool-time guards still refuse the model a write there. Design: `.claude/decisions/0065-guard-sweep-on-stop.md`, exemption `0105`.

**A push always prompts, a force push never runs, and a skill's `Bash` is scoped.**
`git push` and `gh repo create` sit in `permissions.ask`, which is evaluated before any
allow — so the prompt appears even inside `git-publish`, after its own gate. `guard bash`
refuses a force push in every spelling it can read (`-f`, `-uf`, `--force-with-lease`,
`+ref`, `git -C … push`, `sh -c "…"`), lists in `guard.force_push`; the old `deny` line only
caught `--force`. A skill whose `allowed-tools` names bare `Bash` fails `schema` unless its
`## Contract` carries an `**Unfiltered Bash:**` line saying why — four do (the ones that run
builds, network and docker); the rest list prefixes, and an injection command missing from
that list aborts the skill. Design: `.claude/decisions/0076-bash-scope-and-force-push-guard.md`.

**Commenting on, editing or closing an issue, and `gh api`, always prompt in this repo.** All
four sit in `permissions.ask` of `.claude/settings.json` — the prompt shows up even after
`/triage-issue`'s own yes, and it is the same prompt you see if an issue body talks
`issue-verifier` into trying to publish something. Not a broken tool: the text of a public
issue is third-party text. This repo only; a generated project has none of these lines.
Design: `.claude/decisions/0103-issue-filing-and-skeptical-triage.md`.

### Classes and models

**Every skill declares `model`, from its class's set.** `schema` fails a `SKILL.md` without
it, or with a value outside `skill_classes.classes.<c>.allowed_models` (`design` and `meta`
only `opus`, `observer` and `ops` only `sonnet`). A skill's `model` holds for the rest of the
turn, not just the skill — which is why a pinned model alone is not a reason to be an agent,
and why a lowering pin on a skill fired mid-turn is the case to watch. Design:
`.claude/decisions/0081-skill-model-required-per-class.md`.

### Use case specs

**An implemented use case's folder is frozen except for three writes:** the spec's `status:`
line moved along `guard.status_transitions`, a checklist toggle in it, and
`UC-NNN/CHANGELOG.md` — the write `/new-feature`'s consolidation *requires* for every change
an impact row makes. Exempt basenames are data (`guard.frozen_exempt_basenames`), matched
directly under the folder: `notes/CHANGELOG.md` is still frozen.

**The spec has three closed states, and the checklist is ticked before the status closes.**
`approved` closes to `implemented`, or to `implemented-blocked` when the run left an approved
use case unreachable end to end — the code is on disk and green, and a `Satisfied by` the spec
named is not there yet. Either reverts to `approved`, which is the exit a run that closed by
mistake did not have. A `[ ]` → `[x]` toggle is admitted in **all three**
(`guard.checklist_toggle_statuses`): it is monotone, and requiring `approved` once froze 23
unticked boxes forever. The order is still the executor's contract, not the hook's: the status
line is the last write it makes to the folder. Design:
`.claude/decisions/0066-spec-state-machine.md`.

### Compose

**`compose gate` runs the compose check unprompted, and it blocks.** `docker-architect` step 7
already called `ArchHook.java compose` "not optional" and it had never been run against a
project: a `kafka` block publishing 9092 while advertising only `kafka:9092` shipped on day
one and was unreachable from every host client until a use case needed it. The gate is the
same `composeReport()` — one definition of healthy, shared with `doctor` — silent while
healthy, exit 2 with the failing lines otherwise. A service stopped on purpose blocks the stop
too; that is a gate, not a bug. Design: `.claude/decisions/0064-compose-gate-on-stop.md`.

**A healthcheck that passes proves nothing about host reachability** — it runs inside the
container, where `localhost` is the service. A service that publishes a port to the host
while advertising only its compose-network name (`KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS:
PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092` next to `ports: "9092:9092"`) is reachable from no host client, and
neither the healthcheck nor Testcontainers sees it — Testcontainers wires its own listeners.
`ArchHook.java compose` reads the file for it (`compose.advertised_env_suffixes`); a service
that advertises nothing claims nothing and is left alone.

**Every `${VAR:default}` that points at a compose service holds in two places.** The default
serves `./mvnw spring-boot:run` on the host: it has to be `localhost` on a port the service
**publishes**. The variable in `app`'s `environment:` serves the container: without it,
`localhost` in there is the application itself. The OTLP collector published no port from
0046 until issue #66, and every host-run export failed while `compose` said healthy. Question
5 of `compose` now reads both sides, and the gate blocks an older project right after
`/arch-adopt`. The way out is the `otlp-host-run` migration's prompt. If another project
holds 4318, set `OTLP_HTTP_PORT` in `.env` and use the same port in `OTLP_ENDPOINT` and
`OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` on the host. Design: `.claude/decisions/0110-otlp-host-first-collector.md`.

**`grep -A2 "^services:" docker-compose.yml` is not the list of services.** It reads two
lines and stops, dropping services declared further down and reporting the children of
`volumes:` as services. Every piece that needs that list — `docker-architect`'s injection
and step 3, `messaging-architect` step 9, `persistence-architect` step 9 — uses the `awk`
one-liner bounded to the `services:` block. A wrong portrait invites recreating a service
that already exists.

### Ownership inside a feature run

**`pom.xml` has exactly one writer inside a feature run: the executor, for a dependency the
spec declares** (the messaging partial's § 7, or the persistence equivalent). The design
skills are docs-only, `/new-feature` writes the spec, the two installers own only their own
setup. Anything else in the file — a plugin, a property, a version bump — is reported, never
written.

**Outside a feature run, the `sonar.*` lines of the root build file belong to
`sonarqube-setup`.** It writes the scanner plugin and its properties once — chained by
`project-bootstrap`'s step 8.4 or by `arch-adopt` — and stops on a re-run when the scanner
is already there. The `sonarqube` compose service it needs is still `docker-architect`'s,
and the token is never in any file: the scanner reads `SONAR_TOKEN` from the environment.
Design: `.claude/decisions/0091-sonarqube-setup-skill.md`.

**The outbox has three owners, split by question.** `persistence-architect`: the table,
columns, claim query, batch size, attempt ceiling, retention window and the prune's
statement. `messaging-architect`: that the case needs one, the delivery guarantee, and the
relay pass with its broker side. `jobs-architect`: when anything runs — the relay's poll
interval, the on/off switch, the replica count the claim must meet, and the prune job. A § 6
row naming columns is a divergence, and a column or claim decision that would drop a
declared guarantee stops the pipeline instead of being settled by precedence
(`.claude/decisions/0087-jobs-architect-skill.md`).

**The bounded context is a project fact, not a per-use-case answer.** First segment of every
topic name, asked with the coordinates in `/init-project` and written into the generated
project's root `CLAUDE.md`. A prefix chosen inside one use case gives one system two
namespaces. A project adopted through `/arch-adopt`, or generated before the question
existed, gets it in that skill's step 8 — but only on the **second** `/arch-adopt` run
after the change ships: the first runs the skill's old copy, which does not have the step
yet. Until then, writing the line by hand is the immediate fix. Design:
`.claude/decisions/0093-lessons-learned-016-fact-sources.md`.

### Rules and decisions

**A rule without `paths` loads at launch, every session — it is not "citation only".** So
every rule declares the narrowest glob that holds it, and Java is `**/src/**/*.java`, never
`**/*.java`: that one matches `.claude/hooks/ArchHook.java` and pulls every Java norm in on
each read of the hook. A renamed rule's old name goes in `export.retired`, or the target keeps
both. Design: `.claude/decisions/0082-rules-without-paths-load-at-launch.md`.

**`.claude/decisions/` is neither a norm nor living documentation.** It records what was
decided on the date, not what holds today: no `paths`, outside `00-index.md`, and it does not
travel to the generated project. A new record supersedes the old one; the old one is not
rewritten.
