# File types — runtime mechanics

This document explains, for each type of piece used in `.claude/`, what it is, what
it's for, when it enters context, and who invokes it — the model or the user. Every
claim about runtime behavior cites the corresponding section of `claude-help.md` (root
of this repository), which is the single source on how Claude Code behaves in this
project.

---

## Skill

**Lives at:** `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, plus optional `templates/` and
`references/` inside the same folder.

**What it is:** a markdown file with instructions that becomes part of Claude's
repertoire — "the most flexible extension" (`claude-help.md` § 5). The folder name
becomes the command: `.claude/skills/arch-doctor/SKILL.md` creates `/arch-doctor`.

**Purpose:** package a procedure — a checklist or a flow that would otherwise be
pasted repeatedly into chat. In this repository, every design skill
(`use-case-design`, `domain-modeling`, `persistence-architect`, `rest-api-architect`,
`test-architect`) owns a single layer of a feature spec; `project-bootstrap` owns the
8-step procedure that generates a project from scratch.

**When it enters context:** only when invoked. Unlike a `CLAUDE.md`, a skill's body
doesn't load at session start — it loads on the turn it's used, and the rendered
content enters as a message and **stays for subsequent turns**; Claude doesn't re-read
the file afterward (`claude-help.md` § Content lifecycle). That's why a skill should
write permanent instructions ("always do X throughout this task"), not a one-time
step.

**Who invokes it — model or user:**

| Frontmatter | Effect | Example in this repo |
|---|---|---|
| (no control field) | The model decides, from `description`, whether the skill is relevant | `project-bootstrap` — description lists triggers like "scaffolding", "new Spring project"; `git-publish` — auto-invocable, but the side effect (commit/push) sits behind two `AskUserQuestion` gates in the body, not the frontmatter — same D17 pattern |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Only the user invokes it, by typing `/name` | `init-project`, `new-feature`, `arch-doctor` — the three commands documented here are all side-effect-heavy and **don't** fire on their own |
| `user-invocable: false` | Only the model invokes it — background knowledge, no visible command | Not used in this repository today |

The three central commands in this document are all `disable-model-invocation: true` —
a deliberate decision: generating a project or running the feature pipeline has too
large a side effect to fire from inference over the conversation.

**Recognized frontmatter fields** (single source: `.claude/schemas/extensions.json`,
validated by `ArchHook.java schema` — `CLAUDE.md` § Invariant 10):

```
name, description, when_to_use, argument-hint, arguments,
disable-model-invocation, user-invocable, allowed-tools, disallowed-tools,
model, effort, paths, context, agent, background, hooks
```

A field outside this list (e.g. `metadata:`) doesn't raise an error — the runtime
**silently ignores** unknown fields, and `claude plugin validate` lets it through too
(`CLAUDE.md` § Known pitfalls). It's `ArchHook.java schema` that blocks it.

**Dynamic context injection:** the `` !`command` `` syntax runs a command **before**
the content reaches the model and substitutes its output. That's what lets
`init-project` list available blueprints dynamically
(`` !`find .claude/blueprints ...` ``) and `arch-doctor` embed the real output of
`ArchHook.java doctor` inside the skill body (`claude-help.md` § Dynamic context
injection). A command that fails (exit ≠ 0) **aborts the entire invocation** — which
is why `CLAUDE.md` § Known pitfalls warns about pipes inside
`allowed-tools: Bash(command:*)`: each pipe segment needs its own rule, or the whole
command gets blocked before it runs.

**`context: fork`:** runs the skill in an isolated subagent, without seeing the
conversation history — the skill's body becomes the subagent's prompt
(`claude-help.md` § `context: fork`). No skill in this repository uses this field
today: skills here prefer to explicitly delegate via the `Agent tool` to a named
`.claude/agents/*.md` when isolation is needed (see § Agent below).

---

## Rule

**Lives at:** `.claude/rules/<name>.md`.

**What it is:** a norm — "what must be true," never a procedure. `CLAUDE.md` §
Invariant 1 is categorical: *"a norm never mentions a skill, an agent, or a command. If
it needs to, it's a procedure and belongs in a skill."*

**Purpose:** fix a standard that applies whenever certain files are touched — naming
convention (`naming.md`), exception taxonomy (`error-handling.md`), Clean Code limits
(`code-quality.md`), and so on. Each norm has a **single owner**
(`CLAUDE.md` § Invariant 2) — whoever needs it cites the path, never copies the
content.

**When it enters context:** two mechanisms, the first being preferable
(`.claude/rules/00-index.md` § How a rule enters context):

1. **Auto-loading via `paths`** — the rule declares globs in the frontmatter, and
   enters context on its own when a matching file is touched. It doesn't depend on
   someone remembering to cite it.
2. **Explicit citation** — for cross-cutting rules that no glob captures
   (`00-index.md` itself). Whoever needs it cites the path.

Without `paths`, the rule loads **at the same priority as the project's `CLAUDE.md`**,
i.e. every session (`claude-help.md` § 4). In this repository, `architecture-ddd.md`
is the only rule with no `paths` of its own by design: the globs come from the active
blueprint's `architecture_paths`, and only exist once the project has been generated.

**Who invokes it:** nobody invokes a rule — it **loads**, either automatically (via
`paths`) or by citation. There's no `/rule-name` command. That's why the
`00-index.md` table lists, for each rule, "Verified by" instead of "Invoked by": a
rule that needs mechanical verification points to a hook, a build plugin
(Checkstyle), or a test (ArchUnit) — never to itself.

**Recognized frontmatter** (`.claude/schemas/extensions.json`):

```
status (required: active | draft | deprecated), paths (optional)
```

No other field is allowed on a rule — the schema for this type is the strictest of
the three.

---

## Agent (subagent)

**Lives at:** `.claude/agents/<name>.md`.

**What it is:** a specialized assistant that runs in an **isolated context window**,
with its own system prompt, tool access, and optionally its own model
(`claude-help.md` § 7). The frontmatter defines the metadata; the markdown body
becomes the subagent's **system prompt**.

**Purpose — and when NOT to become an agent:** `CLAUDE.md` § Invariant 5 sets the
criterion: an agent is only justified for one of three reasons — preserving context
(verbose output that shouldn't pollute the main conversation), restricting tools, or
switching model. If none applies, the piece is a skill.

This repository's four agents each document explicitly, in their own `## Why this is
an agent` (or `## Why this is Form 3`) section, which reason applies:

| Agent | Context | Tools | Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| `project-initializer` | Verbose output from `starter.tgz` extraction, POMs, build output | `Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, AskUserQuestion, Skill` — restricted. `Skill` is on the list only to invoke `git-publish` after a green build; it doesn't open access to any other skill in the repository | `opus` — validating a dependency graph and restructuring modules fails expensively |
| `java-spring-boot-developer` | The full spec replaces the interview — the agent only executes | `Read, Write, Bash` — only reads spec/templates, only writes to `src/` | `sonnet`, `effort: max` — generating ~19 steps of compilable code |
| `archunit-installer` | `test-architect`'s setup mode has no interview — a Maven Central `curl` and up to three `./mvnw` builds would become permanent in the main conversation if run inline | `Read, Write, Edit, Bash` — inside the project only | `sonnet`, `effort: medium` — translating exemplar packages onto the real blueprint layout and diagnosing an ArchUnit rule failure takes judgment, not just mechanical execution |
| `commons-logging-installer` | Same shape as `archunit-installer`: translates thirteen logging/masking exemplars into the real package, edits a POM, compiles until green — eleven writes and a build log that don't need to land in the context of the `/new-feature` run that triggered it | `Read, Write, Edit, Bash` — inside `commons.logging` and the matching POM only | `sonnet`, `effort: medium` |

The last three are **executors** for the `guard` hook: listed in
`extensions.json` → `guard.executor_agents`, they are the only ones allowed to write
under `src/` while a design phase is open (see [08-audit-usage.md](08-audit-usage.md)).

**When it enters context:** only when invoked — never automatically via `paths`
(agents don't have that field). It **doesn't see** the main conversation's history,
nor the main session's auto memory, nor what was read before (`claude-help.md` § What
the subagent sees). It does see: its own system prompt, the `CLAUDE.md` hierarchy,
git status, the delegation message, and skills preloaded via its own frontmatter's
`skills:` field — that's how `java-spring-boot-developer` loads the entire
`java-patterns` catalog without invoking it as a separate turn.

**Who invokes it:** always another piece of the system, never the user directly via
`/agent-name` — that command doesn't exist. Here, it's always a skill that delegates
via the `Agent tool`: `init-project` delegates to `project-initializer`,
`new-feature` delegates to `java-spring-boot-developer` after consolidating the spec,
`test-architect` delegates to `archunit-installer` in setup mode (no argument).

**Fork — a different kind of agent:** a *fork* inherits the entire conversation
instead of starting from scratch (`claude-help.md` § Forks). Only the final result
returns to the main conversation — internal tool calls stay out of its context. None
of this repository's agents is a fork — all of them receive only the delegation
message, on purpose, because the point is precisely **not** to inherit the noise of
the design conversation.

**Recognized frontmatter fields** (`.claude/schemas/extensions.json`, `case: camel`):

```
name, description, tools, disallowedTools, model, permissionMode,
maxTurns, skills, mcpServers, hooks, memory, background, effort,
isolation, color
```

**Silently ignored files:** an agent with no `name`, with `---` not on the first
line, with `name` starting with `-` or containing `:`, with `name` but no
`description`, or with invalid YAML — Claude Code simply skips the file, with no
visible error (`claude-help.md` § Files silently ignored). That's why this repository
validates with `java .claude/hooks/ArchHook.java schema`, which is strict where the
runtime stays silent.

## `CLAUDE.md`

**Lives at:** repository root (or `.claude/CLAUDE.md`), with additional hierarchy at
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (user) and `./CLAUDE.local.md` (personal, outside git).

**What it is:** the project memory file — instructions the team versions and that
everyone (human or model) reads. `claude-help.md` § 3 describes the full hierarchy;
every level is **additive**, never replacing another.

**Purpose in this repository:** index and routing, not a manual. `CLAUDE.md` § How a
rule enters context and this file's own `## Routing` section work as an "if the task
involves X, go to Y" table — the norm itself lives in the cited skill or rule, never
inside `CLAUDE.md`.

**When it enters context:** always, at session start — files in the current
directory **and every directory above it** load at startup; files in subdirectories
load on demand, when Claude reads something in there (`claude-help.md` § File
hierarchy). Unlike a skill, there's no way for a `CLAUDE.md` to load "only when
needed" — it's always paid for, hence the goal of staying under 200 lines
(`claude-help.md` § Writing an effective CLAUDE.md).

**Who invokes it:** nobody — it loads automatically. The `/init` command generates an
initial `CLAUDE.md` from existing code; `/memory` lists and opens memory files
(native to Claude Code, distinct from this repository's own memory).

**Two relevant versions here:**

| `CLAUDE.md` | Role |
|---|---|
| This repository's root | Documents the meta-repository — architecture invariants of `.claude/`, routing table to this repo's skills |
| `.claude/skills/project-bootstrap/templates/root.CLAUDE.md.example` | Template for the `CLAUDE.md` that `project-bootstrap` writes **inside the generated project** — different data (name, modules, resolved versions), same discipline of staying small and citing by path |

`CLAUDE.md` § Known pitfalls is explicit: *"the `CLAUDE.md` at the root of a generated
project is not this file."* Confusing the two is the most common mistake when editing
this repository.

## Hook

**Lives at:** `.claude/settings.json` (configuration) + `.claude/hooks/ArchHook.java`
(logic).

**What it is:** a script triggered on lifecycle events — "deterministic: it always
happens on the event, regardless of what the model decides. That's the difference
between asking and guaranteeing" (`claude-help.md` § 8). It's the only piece in this
system the model **cannot** opt to skip.

**Purpose:** everything that must always hold, without depending on the model
remembering — `CLAUDE.md` § Invariant 6: *"if a rule must always hold, it's a hook or
`permissions.deny` — not prose in markdown."* `ArchHook.java` has eight modes:

| Mode | Event | Blocks? | What it does | Wired here? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `check` | `PostToolUse` (Write\|Edit) | Yes (exit 2) | Forbidden imports (via `.claude/forbidden-imports.txt`) + incremental compile of the touched module | Yes |
| `format` | `PostToolUse` (Write\|Edit) | Never | `spotless:apply` on the touched module | Yes |
| `tests` | `Stop` | Yes (exit 2) | Runs tests of the modules changed since `HEAD` | Yes |
| `schema` | `PreToolUse` (Write) + `PostToolUse` (Edit) + `Stop` | Yes (exit 2) | Validates skills/agents/rules frontmatter and `.mcp.json` fields against `.claude/schemas/extensions.json`, with a secret scan over `headers`/`env` | Yes |
| `guard` | `UserPromptSubmit` + `PreToolUse` (Skill\|Agent\|Write\|Edit) | Yes (exit 2) | An open design skill never writes under `src/`; a spec folder that is `approved`/`implemented` is immutable | Generated project only |
| `audit` | 10 lifecycle events | Never | Execution trail of every skill and agent: one Markdown report per invocation + ledgers | Generated project only — switched on by the existence of `.claude/audit-usage/` |
| `compose` | Manual; folded into `doctor` | Never | Every compose service is `running`; no foreign container publishes a port this project declares | Yes |
| `doctor` | Manual (`/arch-doctor`) | Never | Diagnoses the setup on this machine | Yes |

The `guard` and `audit` modes are detailed in [08-audit-usage.md](08-audit-usage.md).
Every list the hook reads — recognized fields, skills excluded from auditing, redaction
patterns, guarded paths — is data in `extensions.json`, never a constant in the Java.

**When it enters context:** hooks don't "enter context" as text — they run as an
**external process** (here, `java ArchHook.java <mode>`), and what returns to the model
is structured output (stderr becomes the block reason) or JSON (`claude-help.md` §
Structured JSON output). The `if` field in each `settings.json` entry filters by
permission rule **before** spawning the JVM — without it, every `Write` would pay for
starting a JVM for nothing (`_comment` field in `.claude/settings.json`).

**Who invokes it:** the runtime, automatically, on the configured event — never the
model or the user directly. The only way to run `ArchHook.java` "manually" is via
`java .claude/hooks/ArchHook.java doctor` in the terminal, or indirectly through the
`arch-doctor` skill, which embeds that call via `` !`command` `` inside its own body
(see § Skill above).

**Exec form vs. shell form:** `settings.json` uses **exec form** (`command: java` +
`args: [...]`) instead of shell form — no shell, no execute bit, identical across
Linux, macOS, and Windows (`claude-help.md` § Configuration; `CLAUDE.md` §
Commands). That's why no step of `project-bootstrap` runs `chmod`.

**Exit codes:**

| Code | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success — if stdout is valid JSON, it's parsed |
| `2` | **Blocks the action** (on events that support blocking) — stderr becomes the reason shown to the model |
| Other | Non-blocking error — the action proceeds |

In `PostToolUse`, exit `2` doesn't undo the action (the tool already ran), but stderr
is shown to Claude — that's how `check` reports a boundary violation after the file
has already been written: the write happened, but the model is warned to fix it.

**Where to configure:** `.claude/settings.json` (of this project, versioned) is the
only location used here — there's no personal `~/.claude/settings.json` nor
`.claude/settings.local.json` involved in this flow (`claude-help.md` § Where to
configure lists the other options, including hooks via skill/subagent frontmatter,
not used in this repository).
